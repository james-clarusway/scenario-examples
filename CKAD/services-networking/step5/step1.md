- Create a deployment of 3 replicas, expose it via a ClusterIP service on port 80 and name it as 'nginx-deploy'. Use 'nginx' image. Label the pods of nginx-deploy with 'tier: frontend'. 
- Create a NetworkPolicy named nginx-netpol so that only pods with labels 'role: frontend' can access the deployment and apply it.
