We aim to 
- Create a Pod named 'multi-pod' with two containers with images 'httpd:alpine' and 'alpine:latest'.
- Make a volume of type emptyDir and mount it in both containers.
- For the httpd container, mount it on "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs" and for the alpine container, mount it on "/pod-data".

- There is a file named "multi-container-pod.yaml" under "/root" folder. Correct and run it.
