- Create a Pod named 'init-pod' with 'nginx:latest' image exposed on port 80.
- Add an init container with 'busybox:1.28' image which downloads a page using "wget -o /data/index.html http://info.cern.ch".
- Make a volume of type emptyDir and mount it in both containers.
- For the nginx container, mount it on "/usr/share/nginx/html" and for the busybox container, mount it on "/data".
